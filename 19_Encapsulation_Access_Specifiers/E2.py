# Bank Account With Private Balance
# Requirements
# Create a class BankAccount.
# Private variables:
# __account_number,
# __balance
# Methods:
# deposit(amount) → add money
# withdraw(amount) → deduct money if balance is enough
# get_balance() → return current balance
# Ensure invalid amount (negative or zero) is rejected.
# Use encapsulation to hide sensitive data.

class BankAccount:

    def __init__(self, acc_num, balance):
        self.__acc_num = acc_num        # private attribute
        self.__balance = balance        # private attribute
