Multiprocessing:-  Multiprocessing means running multiple processes at the same time, where 
    each process has its own memory space and runs independently on different CPU cores.
    No GIL problem; True parallel execution

What is a Process? = A full program; With its own memory; Running independently
    
Ex:-  Think of your computer like a house with 4 rooms (4 CPU cores).
    If you assign one worker(process) per room, they can all work at the same time without disturbing each other.

They run IN PARALLEL; They have SEPARATE memory; They are independent

When to Use Multiprocessing? (Very Important)

Use Multiprocessing for:   🧮 Heavy calculations; 🖼 Image processing; 📊 Data analysis; 🤖 Machine Learning;
    🔢 Complex loops

Do NOT use Multiprocessing for:  📁 File reading/writing; 🌐 Network requests; 🗄 Database access;
    These are I/O tasks where threads are better due to lower overhead.

Multiprocessing Functionalities:-
    multiprocessing.Process(target=Function_name):- Creates a new process and assigns a function to run.
    .start():- Starts execution of the process.
    .join():- Makes the main program wait until the process completes.
    .is_alive():- Checks if the process is still running.
    .name:- Returns the name of the process.
