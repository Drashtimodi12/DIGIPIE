# Check Process Status Using is_alive()
# Create a process that:
#     prints “Process working…”
#     sleeps for 3 seconds
#     prints “Process finished”
# While the process is running, the main program should print:
#     Main: Checking process...
#     Alive: True
#         After process ends:
#     Alive: False
# Goal: Learn is_alive() + process monitoring.
