"""What is Function in Python?
A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. 
It also helps to reuse the code. It starts with the keyword 'def' followed by the function name and parentheses ().
You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.

Types of Functions in Python:
1. Built-in Functions   -> print(), input(), len(), type(), range(), round(), etc.
2. User-defined Functions
3. Anonymous Functions (Lambda Functions) 
4. Recursive Functions
