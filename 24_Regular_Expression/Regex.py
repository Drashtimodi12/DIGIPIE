"""
Regex (Regular Expression) is a tool used to search, match, extract, and manipulate patterns from text.
Think of regex like a smart search filter that can find exactly what you want inside a string.

Always import regex module first: import re
Use r"" (raw string) to avoid escaping issues: r"\d+"

Simple Real-Life Examples
    Text: "My phone number is 9876543210"
    Regex: \d{10} → matches 9876543210 (all 10 digits)

    
Why use Regex?
    Validate emails, phone numbers, passwords
    Search for patterns in text
    Replace or extract text
    Split text based on patterns
