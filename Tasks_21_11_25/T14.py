# Create a base class Bird with a method fly(). Create two subclasses Sparrow and Penguin that 
# override fly() differently. Write a function that takes any Bird object and calls its fly() method.

class Penguin(Bird):
    def fly(self):
        print("Penguin is bird, but it cann't fly in the sky.")
