What Are Dunder Methods?
    Dunder = Double UNDERSCORE
    These are special methods in Python that start and end with __.

Examples:- __init__, __str__, __len__, __add__

They are also called:- Magic methods, Special methods

Why Are Dunder Methods Used?
    They allow you to customize the behavior of your objects, such as:
        How your object prints
        How your object compares
        How your object adds / subtracts
        How your object behaves in lists, loops, etc.
        They make custom classes behave like built-in types.


Why Are Dunder Methods Important?
    Because they make your objects behave naturally:
    ✔ You can print objects
    ✔ You can compare objects
    ✔ You can add or subtract objects
    ✔ You can use objects in loops
    ✔ You can use objects with built-in functions (len, str, repr)
